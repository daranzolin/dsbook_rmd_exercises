# Intro to Data Science Exercises

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains the exercises in Rmd format from Rafael A. Irizarry's *[Introduction to Data Science.](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/)*

Clone the repository, open the project, and edit the Rmd templates as needed. Note: some of the files won't knit out of the box, as the code presupposes some loaded packages that occurred elsewhere in the book.
